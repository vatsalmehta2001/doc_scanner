## Core Components

### 1. Document Detection (`doc_scanner/document.py`)

The document detection module uses computer vision techniques to:
- Detect document edges using adaptive methods
- Find document contours in images
- Apply perspective transformation to get a top-down view
- Handle various lighting conditions and backgrounds

Key functions:
- `detect_document()`: Detects a document in an image
- `enhance_document()`: Enhances document image for better readability/OCR
- `estimate_document_type()`: Estimates document type using ML or rules

### 2. Scanner Application (`doc_scanner/scanner.py`)

The scanner application provides a user interface for:
- Capturing documents using a webcam
- Processing documents in real-time
- Saving and enhancing captured documents
- Displaying status and preview information

Key classes:
- `EnhancedDocumentScanner`: Main scanner application class

### 3. Document Classification (`models/document_classifier.py`)

The document classifier uses machine learning to:
- Extract features from document images
- Classify documents into different types (text, ID card, receipt, etc.)
- Provide confidence scores for classifications

Key features:
- Feature extraction based on document properties
- Random Forest classification model
- Fallback to rule-based classification if ML model not available

### 4. Image Enhancement (`models/image_enhancer.py`)

The image enhancer optimizes document images for:
- Better OCR performance
- Improved readability
- Different document types (text, ID card, receipt, etc.)

Enhancement techniques:
- Adaptive thresholding
- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Specialized processing for dark backgrounds
- Color preservation for ID cards and color documents

### 5. Text Analysis (`models/text_analyzer.py`)

The text analyzer extracts structured information from document text:
- Identifies key fields in different document types
- Extracts entities like dates, names, addresses, etc.
- Organizes information in a structured format

Key features:
- Document type-specific analysis
- NLP-based entity extraction (with spaCy if available)
- Regular expression patterns for structured data
- Support for different document layouts

### 6. Advanced Scanner (`scripts/advanced_scanner.py`)

The advanced scanner provides additional features:
- Multi-stage OCR with specialized processing
- Enhanced detection for difficult documents
- Text extraction and clipboard integration
- Multiple enhancement modes

## ML Components

### Document Classification

The document classifier uses a Random Forest model with features extracted from document images:
- Document dimensions and aspect ratio
- Edge density and contour information
- Texture and histogram features
- Text-like region analysis

### Image Enhancement

Image enhancement uses specialized processing based on document type:
- Text documents: Optimized for text clarity and OCR
- ID cards: Preserved colors with enhanced contrast
- Receipts: High contrast with thin text preservation
- Forms: Edge preservation for fields and boxes
- Business cards: Color enhancement with text clarity

### Text Analysis

Text analysis extracts structured information using:
- Document type-specific field extraction
- Regular expression patterns for common data types
- NLP-based entity recognition when available
- Type-specific layout understanding

## Integration Points

The components work together through several integration points:

1. The scanner application uses document detection to find documents in camera frames
2. Detected documents are enhanced and saved
3. Document classification determines the document type
4. Image enhancement optimizes the document based on its type
5. Text analysis extracts structured information from the enhanced document

## Performance Considerations

- Processing is done in a separate thread to maintain UI responsiveness
- Feature extraction is optimized for speed while maintaining accuracy
- Fallback mechanisms ensure functionality even without ML models
- Memory usage is minimized by reusing model instances

## Setup and Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Tesseract OCR engine for text extraction:
   - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
   - Windows: Download from [Tesseract GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

3. Run the scanner:
   ```
   python scripts/advanced_scanner.py
   ```

4. Demo all features:
   ```
   python scripts/quick_demo.py --image path/to/document.jpg --demo-all
   ```

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Robust Document Detection**: Works in various lighting conditions and backgrounds
2. **ML-Based Document Classification**: Identifies document types with high accuracy
3. **Adaptive Image Enhancement**: Optimizes images based on document type
4. **Advanced OCR Processing**: Extracts text from challenging documents
5. **Structured Information Extraction**: Converts document text to structured data
6. **Real-Time Processing**: Maintains responsiveness with multi-threaded design

## Extension Points

The project can be extended in several ways:

1. Add more document types to the classifier
2. Implement additional enhancement techniques
3. Train better OCR models for specialized documents
4. Add support for document template matching
5. Implement document segmentation for multi-section documents
6. Add cloud storage integration for saved documents
